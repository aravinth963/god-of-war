    <h2 id="story recap">God of War (2018) Story Recap</h2>
    <p>
      Our story begins with an end, the funeral of Faye - mother to Atreus and
      wife of Kratos. Her last wish imparted to her family is to scatter her
      ashes on the highest peak in all the realms. This request begins a journey
      that forces father and son to work together as they face the dangerous
      Norse wilds filled with beasts, monsters, and less-than-friendly gods.
    </p>

    <h2 id="the father">The Father</h2>
    <p>
      Kratos, despite trying to leave his bloody past as the Ghost of Sparta
      behind, is still haunted by the man - the god - he was. His relationship
      with Atreus has been distant, stern, and disciplined. Now coping with the
      death of his wife, Kratos must learn to be the father that his son needs
      so they can both survive their journey across distant realms to lay Faye
      to rest.
    </p>

    <h2 id="the son">The son</h2>
    <p>
      Atreus is a young boy dealing with the sudden loss of his mother and a
      cold, distant father. Despite being sickly as a child and only very
      recently recovering enough to travel, Atreus wants nothing more than to
      fulfill his mother's final wish and prove to his father that he is strong.
      Having been taught by Faye how to use a bow and hunt, Atreus hopes that he
      can show Kratos he will be an asset on their journey and that he is no
      longer the frail boy he used to be.
    </p>

    <h2 id="the stranger">Arrival of the Stranger</h2>
    <p>
      After the funeral of Faye, Kratos and Atreus are visited by a mysterious
      stranger - one who seems intent on picking a fight with the legendary God
      of War from a distant land. Baldur says he is sent by Odin to investigate
      the home and its residents, indicating that perhaps he, and the rest of
      the Norse Gods, are much more aware of Kratos' past than even his own son.
    </p>
    <img src="./images/stranger.jpg" alt="baldur and kratos fighting" />
    <p>
      They clash, tearing through the earth and rock surrounding the home in a
      bloody brawl that reveals Baldur has lost the ability to feel anything -
      impervious to pain and pleasure alike. Though the battle is close, Kratos
      is able to harness his rage and finally beats Baldur into submission.
      While he has rid them of the immediate threat, Kratos realizes that his
      home, and his son, are no longer safe. They must make the journey now -
      whether Atreus is ready for it or not.
    </p>
    <h2 id="sons of thor">Sons of Thor</h2>
    <p>
      Along their journey, the trio are ambushed by the two men they saw
      accompanying Baldur, Magni and Modi. They battle Kratos and Atreus
      fiercely, though Kratos is able to strike a killing blow on Magni.
    </p>

    <p>
      Modi flees, but later finds the pair again. By killing Kratos, he hopes to
      regain his honor and prove that he is worthy of Thor's legacy. Modi
      subdues Kratos, but seeing his father in peril, Atreus instinctively
      triggers what appears to be his own Spartan Rage ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not knowing his own godhood, Atreus is overwhelmed by the sudden surge and
      falls unconscious, his childhood illness seemingly returned and worse than
      ever. Kratos fends off Modi, who quickly departs knowing his life is in
      danger. Seeing that Atreus is barely alive, Kratos takes his son to Freya
      in the hopes her magic can help save his son.
    </p>
    <h2 id="death of god">Death of a God</h2>
    <p>
      They fight again, but through their shared strength, Kratos and Atreus are
      finally able to beat the newly vulnerable Baldur, who demands they kill
      him and end his life while he is still able to feel. Freya pleads with
      them to spare her only son, and Kratos relents - knowing all too well the
      pain a parent feels at losing a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they turn to leave, Baldur uses his remaining strength to try and
      strangle Freya as payment for his years of numb torment. Freya accepts her
      death, hoping it will give her son some semblance of peace in his life to
      know she's gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kratos, seeing his own bloody mistakes about to be repeated by Baldur,
      steps in to save Freya's life by killing her son. Unable to accept his
      death, Freya cradles the dead body of Baldur while swearing vengeance upon
      Kratos for taking away her only child, even if it meant that she would
      live.
    </p>

    <h2 id="highest peak">The highest peak in all the realms</h2>
    <p>
      Finally able to make the journey to Jötunheim with the help of Mimir's
      Bifröst eyes, Kratos and Atreus reach a Giant temple - one that has their
      entire journey carved into the walls. The Giants had seen what would come
      to pass, as well as what had come before.
    </p>
    <p>
      They discover that this was all left for them by Faye, who was a Giant
      herself - a secret she had kept from her husband and son. Atreus finally
      uncovers the full truth of his heritage, that he is not only part god and
      part mortal, he is part Giant as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Atreus had two names, one was given to him by his father and the other,
      his mother. The name Faye had bestowed upon him was Loki.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together Kratos and Atreus scatter the ashes on the peak of Jötunheim,
      finally fulfilling their quest.
